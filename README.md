1. Clone this project to your directory.

2. Use 'npm install' to install dependencies.

3. To start API use 'node app.js'

4. To start application use 'node api.js'

Comments :

1. API and application should be in different folders and have different dependencies. But it doesn't matter in this project.

2. I can make this project more obviously MVC using frameworks such as Backbone, for example.
But I hadn't enough time to make a lot of cool things with this project.

3. Also I can use Grunt to minify and uglify files, use Bower to download last version of Bootstrap and so on.
